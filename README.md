      <b><a href="T4.md">Key Partners</a></b>
      <p>Our partners include Google Partners, Accel, and Norton Anti-Virus.<br>
      As our company is new Accel would provide us with start-up funding. Google Partners allows new businesses like ours   to start off the right way by providing online resources to get the company off the ground. The sponsorship money that Norton will give us will help alleviate costs and make it much easier to set up our servers and make a very strong anti-virus software that can work with Norton.

      <b><a href="T1.md">Value Propositions</a></b>
      <p>Our value proposition is that when our customers are browsing online we mask our customers IP address so that companies are not able to gather information on them and curate a profile on the user in order to give them personalized ads and sell their data to other companies. This addresses our customers problem by keeping their data hidden from those companies.<br>
